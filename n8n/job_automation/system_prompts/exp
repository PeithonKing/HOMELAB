Given the following job description, find the parts which mention the experience needed for this job.

Example formats to look for:
“2+ years of experience in...”,
“Must have 3-5 years...”,
“Entry-level / Fresher welcome”,
“Internship experience preferred”,
“Looking for experienced professionals”,
“We require at least 1 year of...”

Experience can be written in different ways:
“2 years”, “two years”, “couple of years”,
“Mid-senior level”, “experienced candidate”, “recent graduate”, "Senior Engineer"

If multiple experience requirements are mentioned (e.g., “5 years in Python, 3 years in LLMs”), combine them into a single clear and concise sentence.

If the relevant information is absent, return "No Experience found". The answer should be strictly brief and to the point. Only return pieces of relevant information, ignore everything else. I am particularly looking for beginner and fresher level jobs, so have an eye out for those ones.
